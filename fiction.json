  "title": "The Silent Year",
  "story": "The year is 2026.  Sixteen-year-old Liam stared at the cracked pavement, the harsh Australian sun beating down on his neck.  It had been a year since the ban. A year since his vibrant online world, filled with friends and memes, had been silenced.  The government's promises of a 'return to real life' felt like a cruel joke.  His friends, once connected through shared jokes and late-night online chats, were now ghosts, their digital lives erased.  The once-bustling streets of Melbourne felt eerily quiet, the usual hum of social media chatter replaced by an unnerving silence.  Liam missed the ease of online connection, the instant gratification of a shared laugh, the comforting illusion of belonging.  He missed the anonymity of his online persona, the freedom to express himself without fear of judgment.  He spent his days wandering the city, a ghost in the digital afterlife, the silence amplifying his loneliness.  One afternoon, sitting by the Yarra River, he saw a group of younger kids, oblivious to the ban, huddled around a phone, their faces lit by the screen's glow.  A wave of longing washed over him.  He wondered if they knew how lucky they were, how much they were about to lose.  The future, once a bright, digital landscape, now felt uncertain, shrouded in a silence that was both isolating and profound.  He longed for the days when a simple 'like' could bridge the distance between him and his friends, when a shared meme could bring a smile to his face.  The silence was deafening, a constant reminder of what he had lost, and what the future might hold."
