  "title": "The President's Seal",
  "story": "The Oval Office was colder than usual, the December air clinging to the heavy drapes. President Biden sat hunched over his desk, the faint scent of old paper and leather filling the air.  The pardon document lay before him, crisp and official, yet somehow fragile.  He’d spent the last few days in a whirlwind of legal briefings, political strategizing, and agonizing self-doubt.  The news cycle had been a relentless barrage – accusations, condemnations, and speculation.  But none of it compared to the weight of his own personal turmoil.  He thought of Hunter, his son, his struggles, his mistakes.  The public saw a scandal; he saw a son.  The legal arguments were clear, the political ramifications were immense, but the human element was overwhelming.  He remembered Hunter as a boy, full of life and promise, and the path that had led them to this precipice.  Signing the document wasn't an act of exoneration, nor a political maneuver.  It was a father's desperate attempt to offer a lifeline, a chance at redemption, a fragile hope for healing.  The pen felt heavy in his hand, each stroke a burden, a commitment, a prayer.  As he signed, the weight of the presidential seal, the weight of his decision, the weight of his love for his son, settled upon him.  The future remained uncertain, but in that moment, in the quiet solitude of the Oval Office, he found a measure of peace, a quiet resolve to face whatever came next, together."
