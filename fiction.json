  "title": "The Ottawa Summit",
  "story": "The snow fell softly on Ottawa, a deceptive calm masking the tension within the Chateau Laurier.  President Trump, his face a mask of barely contained impatience, paced the opulent suite.  The meeting with Prime Minister Trudeau had beenâ€¦productive, in the sense that it had ended without a full-blown trade war erupting.  But the underlying currents of distrust ran deep.  Trump, still smarting from the perceived slights of the previous administration, saw Trudeau's polite diplomacy as a thinly veiled attempt to undermine American interests.  He reread the briefing notes, the statistics on lumber exports, the details of the energy agreements.  Each number felt like a challenge, a subtle jab at his 'America First' agenda.  Across the hall, Trudeau, equally weary, reviewed his own notes.  He'd tried to maintain a calm demeanor, to reassure Trump that Canada remained a valuable ally, but the President's unpredictable nature had left him on edge.  The whispers of impending tariffs still echoed in his ears, a constant threat to the delicate balance of the North American economy.  He knew that the success of this summit, and perhaps the future of the relationship between the two nations, rested on a delicate thread of compromise, a thread that felt increasingly frayed with each passing hour.  The weight of responsibility pressed down on him, a heavy burden in the quiet solitude of the Canadian winter."
