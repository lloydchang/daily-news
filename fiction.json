  "title": "The Last Thanksgiving",
  "story": "The salt spray kissed President Biden's face as he stood on the deck of his Nantucket home, the late November wind whipping his hair.  The news reports blared from the radio inside, a relentless chorus of speculation about the incoming administration's trade policies.  He'd spent the Thanksgiving holiday fielding calls, offering reassurances, and desperately trying to salvage what he could of his legacy.  The threatened tariffs on Mexico and Canada weren't just economic threats; they were personal.  He'd poured years into forging those trade agreements, and the thought of them being torn apart by a stroke of a pen filled him with a bitter disappointment.  He looked out at the churning ocean, the waves mirroring the turmoil in his gut.  He'd spoken publicly, expressing his hope that President-elect Trump would reconsider, but the words felt hollow, a desperate plea against the rising tide of protectionism.  The weight of the presidency, the weight of the world, pressed down on him.  He knew the economic consequences of a trade war would be devastating, not just for the US, but for the global economy.  He'd tried everything – diplomacy, persuasion, even a personal appeal to Trump – but the incoming president remained steadfast.  As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple, Biden felt a profound sense of loss.  It wasn't just the end of his presidency; it felt like the end of an era, a farewell to the carefully constructed international order he'd worked so hard to maintain.  This Thanksgiving, the traditional warmth and togetherness felt distant, replaced by a chilling premonition of the economic storms to come.  The last Thanksgiving of his presidency felt less like a celebration and more like a somber reflection on what might have been."
