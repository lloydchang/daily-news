  "title": "The Wray Replacement",
  "story": "The mahogany desk felt cold beneath Agent Sterling's hands.  The news had hit like a punch to the gut – Kash Patel, a man whose loyalty seemed to reside solely with the President, was now the Director.  Sterling, a veteran of the Bureau, had seen administrations come and go, but this felt different.  This wasn't a subtle shift; it was a seismic upheaval.  The whispers in the hallowed halls of the FBI were frantic – investigations abruptly halted, agents reassigned with alarming frequency.  Sterling knew this wasn't just a change in leadership; it was a systematic dismantling of the institution's integrity.  He had to act, but the risks were staggering.  He began to meticulously document irregularities, gathering evidence in the shadows, knowing that one wrong move could expose him to the full force of Patel's wrath.  His allies were few, his enemies numerous and powerful.  The weight of the Bureau, and the fate of justice itself, rested on his shoulders.  The clock was ticking, and the shadow of the new Director loomed large, threatening to extinguish the last embers of truth."
