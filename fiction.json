  "title": "The Weight of the Seal",
  "story": "The Oval Office was silent, save for the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner. President Joseph Biden stared at the signed pardon, the crisp white paper a stark contrast to the turmoil in his heart.  The pen felt heavy in his hand, heavier than any state document he'd ever signed.  Hunter, his son, was free.  But the relief was a fragile thing, overshadowed by a profound sense of unease.  The whispers had begun months ago, a relentless barrage of accusations and investigations.  His advisors, faces etched with worry, had urged caution, warned of the political fallout.  The polls had plummeted.  His approval ratings were in freefall.  Yet, he'd done it.  He'd pardoned his son, despite the public outcry, despite the potential political suicide.  He justified it as an act of compassion, a father's desperate attempt to protect his child.  But the doubt gnawed at him.  Had he betrayed the public trust?  Had he sacrificed his legacy for the sake of family?  The memories flooded back – Hunter's struggles, his battles with addiction, the constant worry that had shadowed his presidency.  He'd always tried to shield Hunter, even from the harsh glare of the media.  Now, that protection had come at a steep price.  The news cycle was a relentless beast, tearing apart his reputation, his legacy.  He saw the headlines in his mind's eye: 'Biden Pardons Son, Ignites National Fury.'  'President's Actions Undermine Justice.'  The weight of the presidency, the weight of his family, the weight of his own conscience – it was almost too much to bear.  He looked up at the portrait of George Washington, a silent observer of his internal struggle.  The pardon was signed, but the true cost remained to be seen.  The weight of the seal pressed down on him, a heavy burden he would carry for the rest of his days."
