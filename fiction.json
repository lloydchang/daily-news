  "title": "The Congressman's Threat",
  "story": "Congressman David Morales stared out the window of his Capitol Hill office, the city lights blurring into a hazy glow.  The news report replayed in his mind â€“ five of his colleagues, all Democrats from Connecticut, had received bomb threats.  He felt a chill crawl down his spine; it wasn't the first time he'd felt threatened, but the sheer number of targets, the brazenness of the act, sent a wave of unease through him.  He'd been a vocal advocate for stricter gun control, a stance that had earned him both praise and the ire of certain groups.  He'd received his share of angry emails and phone calls, but this was different.  This was a direct threat, a calculated escalation.  He thought of his family, his wife, Sarah, and their two young children, their faces flashing before his eyes.  The thought of them being in danger filled him with a cold dread.  He knew the Capitol Police were investigating, but the feeling of vulnerability persisted, a constant shadow lurking in the corners of his mind.  He picked up his phone, his fingers trembling slightly as he dialed his wife's number.  He needed to hear her voice, to reassure himself, to reassure her.  He knew he couldn't let fear paralyze him.  He was a public servant, elected to represent his constituents, and he wouldn't be silenced.  He would continue to fight for what he believed in, even if it meant facing the darkness that threatened to engulf him.  He hung up the phone, a renewed sense of determination hardening his resolve.  The fight, he knew, was far from over."
