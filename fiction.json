  "title": "The Weight of Justice",
  "story": "The mahogany desk felt cold beneath David Weiss's hands.  The late-night news reports blared from the muted television in the corner, a relentless loop of commentary on the President's pardon of Hunter Biden.  Weiss, Special Counsel, stared at the meticulously crafted legal documents spread across his desk, each page a testament to months of painstaking investigation.  He'd built a case, a solid case, he believed.  But the President's words, echoing through the halls of power, felt like a slap in the face.  'Miscarriage of justice,' the President had declared.  The phrase hung in the air, heavy with implication.  Weiss knew the pressure he was under.  The political fallout was immense, the public outcry deafening.  His team, exhausted and demoralized, looked to him for guidance.  He picked up his pen, the weight of the situation pressing down on him.  He had to respond, not just to the President, but to the integrity of the justice system itself.  The statement he crafted was measured, factual, a defense of the process, a quiet assertion of his team's dedication to the truth.  He knew it wouldn't silence the critics, but it was his duty, his responsibility, to stand by his work, to uphold the principles he believed in, even in the face of overwhelming political pressure.  The weight of justice, he realized, was far heavier than he'd ever imagined."
