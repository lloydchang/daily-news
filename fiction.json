  "title": "The Congressman's Mail",
  "story": "Congressman Ben Carter stared at the manila envelope, its weight disproportionate to its size.  The return address was blank, the postmark smudged, a deliberate act of anonymity.  He'd received similar envelopes before, each containing a single, menacing note, escalating in their threats.  This one felt different, heavier, more ominous.  He'd been a vocal advocate for stricter gun control, a stance that had made him a target for angry constituents, but this felt beyond the usual vitriol.  The threats had started subtly, anonymous calls, hateful emails, but now, the physicality of the envelopes, the deliberate act of sending them through the mail, felt like a direct challenge, a declaration of war.  He thought of his family, his wife, Emily, her quiet strength a constant source of comfort, and his two young children, their innocent faces a stark contrast to the darkness that threatened to engulf them.  He'd always believed in the power of his voice, in the importance of standing up for what he believed in, but the fear was real, a cold dread that seeped into his bones.  He knew the police were investigating, but the feeling of vulnerability persisted, a constant hum of anxiety that vibrated beneath the surface of his daily life.  He carefully placed the envelope on his desk, his hand trembling slightly.  He knew he couldn't ignore it, couldn't let fear dictate his actions.  He was a public servant, elected to represent his constituents, and he wouldn't be silenced.  He picked up his phone, his fingers steady now, and dialed the number of his chief of staff.  The fight, he knew, was far from over."
