  "title": "The Silent Summer",
  "story": "The year is 2025.  Seventeen-year-old Liam scrolled through the empty space on his phone, a familiar ache settling in his chest.  The ban, implemented six months ago, had initially felt liberating â€“ a break from the relentless pressure of online validation.  But the silence was now deafening.  His friends, once bound by shared memes and late-night online chats, were now scattered, their lives a mystery.  The government had promised a renaissance of face-to-face interaction, a return to genuine connection.  But Liam found himself adrift.  The vibrant online community that had defined his teenage years was gone, replaced by awkward silences and strained conversations.  He missed the ease of online connection, the instant gratification of a shared joke, the comforting illusion of belonging.  He missed the way his online persona, carefully crafted and curated, had allowed him to express himself freely, without the fear of judgment.  He spent his summer days wandering the streets, a ghost in the digital afterlife, the silence amplifying his loneliness.  One afternoon, sitting on a park bench, he saw a group of younger kids, oblivious to the ban, huddled around a phone, their faces lit by the screen's glow.  A wave of longing washed over him.  He wondered if they knew how lucky they were, how much they were about to lose.  The future, once a bright, digital landscape, now felt uncertain, shrouded in a silence that was both isolating and profound."
