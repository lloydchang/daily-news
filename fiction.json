  "title": "The Capitol Shadows",
  "story": "The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across Representative Mallory's face as she stared at the cryptic note.  It was tucked into her mailbox, a simple white envelope with no return address, containing only a single sentence:  'Your silence will be your undoing.'  The bomb threat against her colleagues was still fresh in her mind â€“ the fear, the anger, the unsettling feeling of vulnerability.  This note felt different, more personal, more menacing.  She'd been outspoken in her criticism of the rising tide of political extremism, a voice calling for unity and reason in a deeply divided nation.  Had her words provoked this threat?  She looked out the window at the Capitol building, its majestic dome silhouetted against the night sky.  It was a symbol of democracy, of the ideals she fought to protect, but tonight, it felt like a fortress under siege.  The police investigation was underway, but the sense of unease lingered.  She knew the threat wasn't just against her; it was against the very fabric of their democratic process.  The note was a chilling reminder of the fragility of their institutions, the ease with which fear and intimidation could undermine the foundations of their society.  As she reached for her phone to call her chief of staff, she felt a cold dread creep into her heart.  The fight for democracy, she realized, was far from over.  The shadows of extremism were lengthening, and the battle for the soul of the nation was far from won."
