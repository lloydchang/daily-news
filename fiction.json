  "title": "The Gavel's Echo",
  "story": "The fluorescent lights of the National Assembly hummed, a stark counterpoint to the low thrum of anxiety that vibrated through the chamber.  Representative Park, her knuckles white as she gripped her pen, watched as the impeachment motion was read aloud.  The words, stark and accusatory, detailed President Yoon's controversial declaration of martial law – a decision that had plunged Seoul into a night of chaos and bloodshed.  Park had seen the images – the tear gas, the clashes between protestors and riot police, the terrified faces of ordinary citizens caught in the crossfire.  She'd heard the whispers of dissent, the growing chorus of voices demanding accountability.  The President's claim that the martial law was necessary to quell social unrest felt hollow, a flimsy justification for a power grab.  Now, the weight of the nation rested on the shoulders of the Assembly members.  The vote would be close, a knife-edge decision that could determine the fate of South Korean democracy.  Park knew the President's loyalists were numerous and powerful, their influence woven deep into the fabric of the government.  But the opposition, fueled by public outrage and a shared commitment to justice, was determined to fight.  The debate raged, a tempest of accusations and rebuttals, of impassioned pleas and bitter recriminations.  Park spoke, her voice ringing with conviction, recounting the events of the previous night, the human cost of the President's actions.  As the hours ticked by, the tension in the chamber thickened, palpable and suffocating.  Finally, the moment arrived.  The Speaker called for the vote.  The silence that followed was deafening, broken only by the rhythmic tapping of a single pen against a desk.  Then, the gavel fell.  Impeachment had passed.  A wave of relief washed over Park, a fragile hope blooming amidst the lingering uncertainty.  The gavel's echo resonated through the Assembly, a symbol of the people's power, a testament to the enduring strength of democracy."
