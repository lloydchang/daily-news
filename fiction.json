  "title": "The Lighthouse Keeper's Daughter",
  "story": "The earth lurched, a violent shudder that sent Maya sprawling across the floor of her family's seaside cottage.  The tsunami warning shrieked from the old radio, a desperate wail swallowed by the growing roar of the ocean.  Maya, barely sixteen, knew what the sound meant.  Her father, a weathered lighthouse keeper, had spent years drilling into her the importance of preparedness.  Now, his lessons were her lifeline.  She grabbed her younger brother, Leo, and raced towards the high ground, the ground trembling beneath their feet.  Behind them, the waves began their relentless advance, a monstrous wall of water consuming everything in its path.  They reached the clifftop just as the first wave crashed against the shore, a terrifying spectacle of nature's raw power.  From their vantage point, they watched in horror as their home, and their town, were swallowed by the churning water.  The lighthouse, a steadfast sentinel against the storm, stood defiant, a beacon of hope in the chaos.  Hours later, when the water receded, leaving behind a trail of devastation, Maya and Leo began the long, arduous journey to safety.  They were survivors, but their lives were forever changed.  The memory of the roaring waves, the destruction, and the desperate fight for survival would forever be etched into their hearts.  The lighthouse, battered but standing, remained a symbol of resilience, a testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit in the face of nature's fury.  Maya, the lighthouse keeper's daughter, had faced the storm and emerged, forever changed, but still standing."
