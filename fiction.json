  "title": "The Coastal Keeper",
  "story": "The earth groaned, a low rumble that escalated into a violent shudder.  Old Man Finnigan, weathered and worn like the driftwood on his beach, felt it in his bones.  He'd lived through countless tremors, but this one felt different, a primal scream from the depths.  The tsunami warning blared from his ancient radio, a frantic cry swallowed by the rising roar of the Pacific.  He grabbed his granddaughter, Maya, a bright-eyed girl of ten, and raced towards the high ground, the ground trembling beneath their feet.  They weren't fast enough to outrun the first wave.  It crashed over them, a monstrous wall of water that ripped them from their feet, tossing them like ragdolls.  Maya clung to her grandfather, his grip surprisingly strong, as they were swept inland.  When the water finally receded, they found themselves clinging to a splintered piece of their old pier, surrounded by the wreckage of their coastal town.  The lighthouse, a steadfast sentinel for generations, stood defiant, a beacon of hope amidst the devastation.  They were survivors, but their lives were forever changed.  The memory of the roaring waves, the crushing weight of the water, and the desperate fight for survival would forever be etched into their hearts.  The lighthouse, battered but standing, remained a symbol of resilience, a testament to the enduring strength of the human spirit in the face of nature's fury.  Old Man Finnigan, the coastal keeper, and his granddaughter, Maya, had faced the storm and emerged, forever changed, but still standing, their bond forged in the crucible of the tsunami."
