  "title": "The Loyalty Test",
  "story": "The mahogany desk felt cold beneath Agent Sterling's fingertips.  The news had hit like a punch to the gut: Kash Patel, a man known more for his unwavering loyalty to the President than his experience in law enforcement, was the new Director of the FBI.  Sterling, a veteran agent with a spotless record and a deep-seated belief in the rule of law, felt a chill crawl down his spine.  He'd seen the subtle shifts before â€“ the pressure to close cases quickly, the hushed conversations about politically sensitive investigations.  But this? This was a seismic shift.  Patel's appointment wasn't just a change in leadership; it was a declaration of war on the very principles the FBI was founded upon.  Sterling knew he had a choice to make.  He could fall in line, navigate the treacherous waters of political expediency, and protect his career.  Or he could fight, risk everything, and uphold the integrity of the Bureau.  The weight of that decision pressed down on him, heavy as the classified files stacked on his desk.  He looked out the window at the Washington Monument, a symbol of American ideals, now shrouded in the uncertainty of the new administration.  The loyalty test wasn't just for the agents; it was for the entire nation.  And Sterling knew, with a certainty that settled deep in his bones, that he had to choose his side."
