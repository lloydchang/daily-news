<title>Randomly Edited Page (Again!)</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This page has been randomly edited yet again!</h1>
<p>It now contains different random text: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog, then naps under a giant oak tree.  A quirky badger watches from afar.</p>
<img src="https://via.placeholder.com/350x200" alt="Another Random Placeholder Image">
<p>Added another new paragraph with a list and a bold item, and an italicized item, and a strikethrough item:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li><b>Item 2 (bold!)</b></li>
  <li><em>Item 3 (italic!)</em></li>
  <li><s>Item 4 (strikethrough!)</s></li>
  <li>Item 5</li>
</ul>
<p>And yet another paragraph!  This time with a link to a different site and some extra text: <a href="https://www.google.com">Google Link</a>  This is some extra text added to the paragraph.</p>
<p>A completely new paragraph added at the end!  This paragraph contains a numbered list:</p>
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
<p>And another completely new paragraph added at the very end!</p>
